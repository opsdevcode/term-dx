# Jira and Atlassian Integration

When the user asks about Jira issues, tickets, projects, or Atlassian-related tasks, use the **atlassian** MCP server tools. The Jira and Confluence skills at `.cursor/skills/jira/SKILL.md` and `.cursor/skills/confluence/SKILL.md` provide detailed guidance -- read them when handling Atlassian requests.

## MCP Server

The `atlassian` MCP server is configured in `.cursor/mcp.json` and provides tools for both Jira and Confluence. Use `ListMcpResources` to discover available tools if needed.

## Jira Conventions

- **Primary project key**: `PLAT` (platform/infrastructure work)
- Always include issue keys (e.g. `PLAT-123`) and direct links in responses
- When searching, default to the current user's open issues unless told otherwise
- Use JQL for advanced searches (e.g. `project = PLAT AND status = "In Progress" AND assignee = currentUser()`)

## Workflow

1. **Search before create** -- check for duplicates or related issues before creating new ones
2. **Be specific** -- include project key, issue type, summary, and description when creating issues
3. **Link related work** -- when working on infrastructure changes, offer to link or update related Jira issues
4. **Transition awareness** -- when updating issue status, use the project's workflow transitions (e.g. To Do -> In Progress -> In Review -> Done)

## Common Tasks

| User says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "my issues", "my tickets" | Search for current user's open issues |
| "bugs in PLAT" | JQL search: `project = PLAT AND type = Bug AND status != Done` |
| "create a story" | Create issue with type Story in specified project |
| "update PLAT-123" | Update the specified issue fields |
| "move PLAT-123 to In Progress" | Transition the issue |
| "link to confluence" | Link Jira issue to Confluence page |
